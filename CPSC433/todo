1. Implement kontrol
   -Currently we should just shoot for what we discussed in our last meeting, combining the best and the worst solution, and mutating a random solution, and going with whatever produces the best result
   -Long term it would be cool to have some chaining going on here

2. Test cases
   -We need test cases

3. Optimizations
   -Implement more intelligent or tree search, i.e. based on solution penalty
   -Change buildDown method to be iterative
   -Change all instances of linear sort to merge sort
   -Consistent use of data structures


4. Code cleanup
   -Remove Solution/TempSolution classes from Parser
   -Modify SolutionInterface to conform with what we have
   -Clean up ExamSchedule
   -General code cleanup
